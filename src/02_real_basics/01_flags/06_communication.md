## What Are You Trying to Say?!

The final thing to consider with flags is what information you're trying to get from the user. Should the flag be the user telling the program a special case is present, a special case is *not* present, or do a particular task?

Unfortunately there isn't a standard answer for this. The best thing I can say, is to simply put a lot of thought into whether you want the flag to be *positive* or *negative*.

A *positive* flag tells the program of a particular task, or condition. Whereas a *negative* flag tells the program of the *lack* of a particular task or condition.

Usually, although not always, positive flags are good for common case scenarios, and negative flags are good for exception case scenarios.
