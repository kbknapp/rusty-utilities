# Alternate Long Forms

There is another version of the long form, which uses a single hyphen followed by two or more characters. In the example *all* the way the top, `-flag` was used. This form is far less common today, but still appears from time to time. We won't spend much time talking about this form, and in fact I would recommend avoiding it all together. This is because it's mutually exclusive with the next item on our list, which in my opinion is far more useful and common.
