# Argument Parsing

Finally. This is the subject of this book.

It's also argument parsing that causes the real trouble. This is where design gets messy, reputations get tarnished, lasting impressions are made, puppies cry, jars of peanut butter getting stolen, etc.

This is also where perhaps very little thought goes into when designing the program. Perhaps it's because it's not the star of the show, which is natural, when building a program to calculate accumulated unicorn hair trimmings, one is excited about unicorn hair trimming and not about how properly parse arguments.

Hopefully throughout this book you'll see that by giving some forethought, and not after-thought, to argument parsing in particular you can really come out ahead of the game when it comes to these Rusty Unicorn Hair Trimming Utilities.
