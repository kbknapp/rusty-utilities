# What is a CLI

First, let's discuss what a CLI is, and why we should care about it.

As stated previously, CLI stands for Command Line Interface and is the portion of a program which interacts with the user, or the way in which the user interacts with the program.

But what if you'd like your program to behave in a slightly different way if certain scenarios exist? What if there is information you program must know in order to operate, but doesn't have that information at compile time? These are all problems solved by use of a CLI.

Let's use a practical example...
